                        Growing up without access to the resources, mentorship, or guidance so many students need, Jonnathan knows firsthand the challenges immigrant and first-generation youth face. It was that experience—and the pain of navigating those struggles alone—that inspired him to create the Overcoming Adversity Cariño Scholarship Foundation: a movement rooted in love, community, and the belief that no student should be left behind simply because of their status or circumstance.
                        </br></br>
                        Today, Jonnathan leads as Founder of the Foundation and CEO of Sin Fronteras Consulting LLC, providing strategic support to nonprofits and businesses committed to impact. He also serves as Co-President of the Greater Marysville Tulalip Chamber Foundation and as a finance committee member and board member for the Snohomish Community Foundation—always working to expand access to education, opportunity, and generational wealth for the communities he represents.
