My name is Karla, and I am 19 years old. My ultimate goal is to become a psychologist or work in early childhood education, where I can make a meaningful impact on children’s lives. The Overcoming Adversity Cariño Scholarship has been a tremendous blessing, lifting the financial burden off my shoulders and allowing me to focus entirely on my education. With this support, I can continue expanding my knowledge and pursuing my passion without the constant worry of financial strain. This scholarship is not just assistance—it’s an opportunity to build a future where I can give back and make a difference.
